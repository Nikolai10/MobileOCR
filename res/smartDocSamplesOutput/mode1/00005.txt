How to make Easy and pretty healthy ground turkey over rice

This is something I make when I am lazy and looking for a quick and simple meal. I only call
it healthy because it has lots of veggies and I am not adding additional salt or oils. The amount of
veggies helps you feel full without all of the calories. Veggies are 0 points for weight watchers so you
would only have to count the calories/fat from the meat and rice. In my case, the whole meal was
under 5 points. heat up pan (use oil if you do not have a non stick) + cook the meat add soy sauce
+ rice wine + water + cumin add all of the chopped up veggies (your choice to add all green onions,
half or none) simmer until everything is cooked thoroughly add on top of rice and sprinkle uncooked
green onions on top
